Gale-Shapley Example
===========

This is a little example of Gale-Shapley's algorithm.
It tries to make the best combination between N men x N women, each of them having a preference list of length N.
It is useful to get the best match between two parts and can be extended to have more conditions and variables, becoming more and more complex.
I made a project using this algorithm to create a new idea/alternative to improve the logistics sector and I hope to share it soon.

This little example was made with netbeans, so if you download it all, will be easy to open the project with NetBeans.
